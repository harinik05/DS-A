# Solution Algorithm

## PART A: Main runner code (int)
1. intialize the lengths of the rows and columns
2. do a double for loop that goes through them
3. check the grid value and if its equal to 1 increment the counter
4. also check the bfs function
5. in the end, just return the value of the counter


## PART B: BFS Code (void)
1. check the boundaries and check if visited - return
2. check off the visited by converting to 'o'
3. recursively call this - up, down left, right
