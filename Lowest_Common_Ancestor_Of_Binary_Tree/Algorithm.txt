Here is the procedure for finding the lowest common ancestor of binary search tree
KEY -> DRIFT WITH THE DIRECTION OF P AND Q
1. Set a current and come up with the base case
2. While current != null-> go right if p and q are bigger
3. go left if p and q are smaller
4. else-> return root

5. worst case -> outside: return null
